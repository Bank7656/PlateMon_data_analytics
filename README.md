PlateMon Data Analytics

Overview

This repository houses the data analysis project for lab-scale, real-time data collected from nickel-watt bath electroplating experiments. The primary goal is to process, analyze, and visualize the experimental data to gain insights into the electroplating process.

Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```bash
.
├── src/
│   └── __init__.py
│   └── load.py
│   └── plot.py
├── monitoring_data.ipynb
├── requirements.txt
└── .gitignore
```

    monitoring_data.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

    requirements.txt: Specifies the Python dependencies required to run the notebooks and scripts.

    src/: (Optional) Directory for any supplementary Python scripts or modules that support the main analysis.

    .gitignore: Defines files and directories that Git should ignore.

Technologies Used

    Python: The core programming language for data analysis.

    Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration, analysis, and visualization.

    Key Libraries: (Likely to include, but confirm from requirements.txt):

        pandas for data manipulation.

        numpy for numerical operations.

        matplotlib and/or seaborn for data visualization.

        (Potentially scipy for statistical analysis, scikit-learn for any modeling if applicable, etc.)

Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites

    Python 3.x installed.

    pip (Python package installer).

Installation

    Clone the repository:
    Bash

git clone https://github.com/Bank7656/PlateMon_data_analytics.git
cd PlateMon_data_analytics

Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the required packages:
```bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Running the Analysis

    Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    Bash

    jupyter notebook

    In the Jupyter interface, open monitoring_data.ipynb.

    Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to execute the data analysis and view the results.
